## Robomatn

RobomatN is a simple personal mashup of Roboto + Vazirmatn made so Persian/Arabic and Latin text look perfect together on my Android without any tofu.

What’s here
- Built font (.ttf & .sfd)

Quick install
1. Clone:
   git clone https://github.com/muctebanesiri/Robomatn.git

Usage
- Android: you can replace robomatn with your defualt font on any android.

License & notes
- This combines Roboto and Vazirmatn, both are open source so Robomatn is opensource too.
- I made this for my daily Android use. Feel free to use or tweak; PRs/issues welcome.

That's it.
