> [!danger] Note  
> If you're familiar with Vazirmatn, you may wonder what the difference is between Robomatn and Vazirmatn. Since both are Vazirmatn + Roboto.
> The short answer is:
> there is no significant difference. After the tragic passing of Saber Rastikerdar, the creator of Vazirmatn, his project became unmaintained. After years of using Vazirmatn, I began to notice some tofu display issues here and there, which led me to merge the latest version of Roboto with Vazirmatn. This resulted in a more clear tofu-free font.
> also I don't know how I did the math but Robomatn has 2767 more glyphs than Vazirmatn.
